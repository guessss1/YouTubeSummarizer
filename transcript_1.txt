(00:01) hi there everyone welcome to the very first day of the kaggle generative AI intensive course a 5day course being delivered virtually so that you can learn everything there is to know about generative Ai and how to use it in your AI applications today we have a bunch of really great guest speakers that are going to be talking all about foundational models as well as prompt engineering um and even though we had a couple of snags on the live stream earlier this morning um we've packed ped up to uh the video all together um such

(00:33) that you'll be able to have a really really nice experience walking through both an overview of the course a Q&A um a brief overview of some of our code labs and then also finally our Pop Quiz towards the end of this series um so this uh this 5-day course on generative AI with Google um by kagle will give you daily assignments in the form of white papers and podcasts that you'll be asked to listen to um these assets explain the what and how of how all of the generative AI uh generative AI models uh

(01:09) tools like vector databases um agents how all of these different uh different techniques and uh different techniques and tools work together um and the accompanying collab notebooks are intended to show you how to use it um both our generative AI uh apis as well as other assets um like open- Source tools that that you might use with them um we've also got a great Discord channel for you to discuss and uh uh and to to kind of brainstorm ideas um and to also get direct uh the direct ability to engage in Q&A with our guest

(01:47) speakers um we're hoping that you'll take this moment to to kind of Deep dive into all of the content that we've created and to learn some of the fundamental important uh and kind of top of- mind Concepts around Tech with generative models um so as I mentioned this is a 5ay program um uh over the course of November 11th through November 15th today is our very first day um and it will be discussing all about foundational models and prompt engineering so with that and without further Ado let's get started with our

(02:23) Q&A for this very first Day greetings and welcome everyone we're excited to have you today for our first day in our generative AI intensive course sponsored by kaggle and the Gemini team um we have a lot to cover today so I'm going to get right into it um everything from answering the great questions that you've been asking on Discord um to having some exciting guest speakers kind of talk about what they've been working on also walking through some collabs and some demos uh and then finally a pop quiz um so really excited

(02:58) to have you here today we've been really energized by the great questions that you've been adding on Discord um and I'm excited to see just uh just how much everyone is is caring about learning more um learning more about large language models multimodal models uh and generative AI at large um my name is Paige I'll be your host for this week um and I am joined by many of my colleagues here today um and hopefully uh hopefully we'll be doing some introductions a little bit later um so this 5-day

(03:31) generative AI intensive course has a combination of daily assignments um the Discord threads that we've been uh that we've been discussing as well as these live Q&A sessions um we'll have them five days a week from November 11th to November 15 um and it covers everything from foundational models and prompt engineering to embeddings and Vector databases AI agents domain specific models um and even mlops for how you can maintain these model systems over time um today is all about foundational models and prompt engineering and so we

(04:04) have many uh many folks on the call who have been doing this as their day job for the past many years um and who are uh uh kind of experts to help answer your questions as you cover all of the great readings and the and the chat threads and the discussions each um each day so with that I am going to get into it in the interest of time to make sure that we have uh we have ample space to discuss all of your questions um this Q&A segment will be a continuation of all of the things that you've been seeing on Discord um and I want to make

(04:35) sure to thank our wonderful uh generative AI discourse moderators poong cause Mark Eric Irwin miles and many of the other folks that have been kind of diving in and helping um make sure to Emoji thank them um and also uh also text thank them I I know that they've been busy uh and working in every single time zone the the Sun never sleeps on uh on General of AIA Google um so with that uh day number one um our expert host panel includes Logan Kilpatrick um who's the product lead for AI studio um Lee Boonstra um Alexi severon um Majid Amin

(05:18) baroon um Daniel manowitz H Chuck and an not um and I'm excited to have everyone here today um uh as an example um uh we have folks that have worked on reinforcement learning with human feedback um people who have been working on uh people who have been working on the Gemini app model inference um making it performant and efficient um technical directors from the office of our CTO um and even more um and with that I'm going to go ahead uh and uh and start with our first question um to Logan good to see

(05:55) you Logan how are you doing I'm doing awesome I'm excited to both hear the questions from folks but also hear some of the questions for some of the other uh panelists excellent very cool and the ml developer team has been shipping so much just recently it feels like every day I log on to to LinkedIn or to Twitter um or X or or whatever it's called now it seems like there have been new product releases um tell me which features you're most excited about um and which uh which have already launched or about to launch yeah that's
